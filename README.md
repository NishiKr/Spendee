# Spendee

Spendee is a ultra-small spending tracker app that allows you to keep an accurate count of all your purchases on a monthly basis.

You pull out your phone, open the app, and you're greeted with your monthly purchase sum. Type the price of the burger or coffee you just bought into the text input box, hit add and you're done. That's it, there's nothing else to it.

Most people have an idea of how much they should spend every month, but who's going to actually remember every individual thing they bought every single day? Instead you just type it into Spendee and it keeps track of your total monthly expenditures so you can always know how much you're spending each month.
